## Linked List 
- [Plus One Linked List ](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one-linked-list/description/)
	- Need multiple pointers to store all the necessary information to reduce runtime and space complexity 
	- Identify the pattern and the best way to achieve problem  

## Binary Search 
- [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
	- This is the ultimate idea of binary search 
- [Find a Peak Element II ](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-a-peak-element-ii/)
	- Traversing 2D matrix to find peak. 
	- Choose to iterate on column or row based on which size is smaller 
	- Then apply the idea of binary search to reduce runtime 
- [Missing Element in Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-element-in-sorted-array/description/?envType=study-plan&id=algorithm-iii)
	- To find the number of missing elements in the array, do `missing = nums[index] - nums[0] - (index - 0)`

## Divide and Conquer 
- [Sort List ](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/description/)
	- Classic MergeSort. Need to learn about how to divide using pointers and how to recursively merge the result 
	- Uses three pointers. Slow and Fast pointers are used to find the middle, and the Prev is used to remove the link between the link 

## DP 
- [Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/submissions/919251523/)
	- Figure out how to solve from smaller problems 
	- Build up problems piece by piece 
	- 

## Greedy 
- [Remove K Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-k-digits/description/) 
	- Use array and stack for easy manipulation. 
	- Compare the current string with the top of the stack, pop everything that is bigger than the current digit 
	- **This is greedy because we are building up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the best one**
