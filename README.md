# My-Neetcode-Notes

My personal notes for all the Leetcode questions.

>Just off the top of my head. Master DFS and BFS. Like, be able to visualize the flow in your head. Memorize the code for each so you can type them out without thought (the code is very short). When solving the Leetcode DFS and BFS problem see when to use either. Dynamic Programming is just DFS + memorization. Backtracking is just DFS + pruning. Generating permutations/combinations/etc. is just DFS/BFS + saving state. The list goes on.
>
>Binary Trees and methods to traverse them (preorder, in-order, post-order) are seen a lot too. Same for binary search trees and the ways to find relationships among nodes (lowest common ancestor, is balanced, etc.)
>
>That should get you most of the way. The rest are smaller patterns that work on much fewer problems (like string manipulation or palindrome). Just do the tagged problems on Leetcode until you’ve seen enough where it’s likely you’ve seen the problem and solution if it comes up in an interview.

>For more obscure questions, hopefully prep in the above will have sharpened your problem solving skills. It’s the luck of the draw, so if you get these, don’t beat yourself up if you mess it up. You can also just memorize top asked Leetcode questions for the company that fall into this category.
