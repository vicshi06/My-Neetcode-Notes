## Tips
- [How to approach most of DP problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/solutions/156523/from-good-to-great-how-to-approach-most-of-dp-problems/)

## [Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)
- Top-down **DP**, think from the result perspective. How to break down the final problem into smaller sub-problems? 
- establish base cases 
- do memoization 
- traverse into two branches 
- for Bottom-up **DP**, understand the frequencies and how many times it needs to be run 
	- start from the final element, and slowly approach to the front 

## [Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/description/)
- remember to use memoization for Top-down **DP**
- for Bottom-up **DP**, understand where to start and where to end 

## [Pascal's Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-08)
- the middle elements are created using results from earlier components, which is **DP**
- take care of the first and last element and the middle can be solved using **DP**

## [House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/)(n)
- Top-Down **DP**: break the problem down into recursive relation, then do memoization 
	- if the recursion ends at the element after the end, base case `i <= 1`
	- if the recursion should consider the last element, base case `i < 0`
- Bottom-Up **DP**: think from the final step perspective, then work backwards  
	- if you need to consider the last element, append an 0 to the list
